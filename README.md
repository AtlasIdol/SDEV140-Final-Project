# SDEV140-Final-Project
This project is designed to be a GUI Lottery Simulator
The program opens with two buttons to select from two (slightly) different lottery style games that mimic the state lottery and the Mega Millions games.
After selecting the game to play, the user is presented with a window to allow for entering numbers, and a button to make the lottery drawing.
The button also provides results.
I was thinking about using another button (made visible after the other button is clicked?) that will take the user back to the initial screen to start the process over.
Part of the project requires a user manual of sorts ... possibly a menu option that will retrieve a text file and display it on a scrollable text box?
Another requirement of the project is to use graphics or images, but I (admittedly) stink at this.
